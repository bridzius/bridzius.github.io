        <h2>Distractions</h2>
        <p>
          There is probably no better way of expressing and preserving thoughts
          than writing. I've wanted to document my ideas for multiple years now.
          This turned out to be harder than expected: my brain decided it
          wouldn't let me write and instead drift away into doing arbitrary
          tasks. In the end - this paragraph took me 4 and a half years to
          write.
        </p>

          When I put my mind to it - everything can become a distraction. I had
          started the same way back then, in 2016: in front of a computer,
          looking at an "index.html document". The I realized, "I want colour!".
          And not just any colour - the background and font colour was supposed
          to change on every reload, but the contrast should still be correct
          and everything was still supposed to be legible. 3 months of looking
          into it to brought a mostly working website and I learned a lot about
          luminance, HSL and different hues. Also - I was tired of the whole
          blog idea and just went away for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward two years or so - I was back. Armed with new explosive
          enthusiasm to start all over, I was now ready to skip all the
          distractions and dive straight into writing! Unfortunately, 2018-2019
          were the years of the static site generator: Jekyll, Hugo and Gatsby
          were big, Scully for Angular (big Angular user here) was released and
          various other examples were taking the community by storm, empowering
          writers to easily scaffold and format their content. Great products
          like Medium was quickly gaining traction, which threw out the whole
          idea of hosting your website or writing code altogether! This would
          have been the perfect time to skip all the styling, jump straight into
          the content and finally start the blog writing journey...
        </p>

          Nope! I live and breathe corporate. I wake up feeling like an
          enterprise, and go to sleep thinking like business. "Not Invented
          Here" (more about this in the future) flows deep within my veins: if I
          am to use something, I better understand how it works! This lead dow a
          Wonderland-like rabbit hole and ended up with
          <a href="https://github.com/bridzius/blankpage" target="new_page"
            >blankpage</a
          >
          - my take on a static site generator. Very basic, barely works, but
          fully mine. This was a great distraction for a year or so of off and
          on again development. Tinkering with code styling, implementing
          Markdown support, making it somewhat pluggable (if it's worth doing -
          it's worth overdoing) were great companions for early morning
          espressos. Notice, how none of this involved writing any posts yet. In
          the end - it sort of worked - maybe it will even work better in the
          future - but I was still post-less. Fast forward one or two more
          years.

          Productivity hacking is all the rage now. We are taught to wake up
          early (check), get at least some exercise in every day (yup), create
          notes and reminders for the day and close them during the day (been
          there) and many other things to get those little wins while we're
          stuck at home for weeks on end. For me - the perfect time to start
          writing. This time - no styling, no static site generation, no
          templates. Just me, the keyboard and an "index.html".
