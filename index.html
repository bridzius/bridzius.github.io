                    There is probably no better way of expressing and preserving
                    thoughts than writing. I've wanted to document my ideas for
                    multiple years now. This turned out to be harder than
                    expected: my brain decided it wouldn't let me write and
                    instead drift away into doing arbitrary tasks. In the end -
                    this paragraph took me 4 and a half years to write.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I put my mind to it - everything can become a
                    distraction. I had started the same way back then, in 2016:
                    in front of a computer, looking at an "index.html document"
                    , when I realized, "I want colour!". And not just any colour
                    - the background and font colour was supposed to change on
                    every reload, but the contrast should still be correct and
                    everything was still supposed to be legible. 3 months of
                    looking into it to ended up in a mostly working website and
                    I learned a lot about luminance, HSL and different hues. But
                    no text. Also - I was tired of the whole blog idea and just
                    went away for some time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward two years or so - I was back. Armed with new
                    explosive enthusiasm to start all over, I was now ready to
                    skip all the distractions and dive straight into writing!
                    Unfortunately, 2018-2019 were the years of the static site
                    generator: Jekyll, Hugo and Gatsby were big, Scully for
                    Angular (big Angular user here) was released and various
                    other examples were taking the community by storm,
                    empowering writers to easily scaffold and format their
                    content. Great products like Medium were quickly gaining
                    traction, which threw out the whole idea of hosting your
                    website or writing code altogether! This would have been the
                    perfect time to skip all the styling, jump straight into the
                    content and finally start the blog writing journey...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nope! I live and breathe corporate. I wake up feeling like
                    an enterprise, and go to sleep thinking like business. "Not
                    Invented Here" (more about this in the future) flows deep
                    within my veins: if I am to use something, I better
                    understand how it works! This lead down a Wonderland-like
                    rabbit hole and ended up with
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/bridzius/blankpage"
                        target="new_page"
                        >blankpage</a
                    >
                    - my take on a static site generator. Very basic, barely
                    works, but fully mine. This was a great distraction for a
                    year or so of off-and-on again development. Tinkering with
                    code styling, implementing Markdown support, making it
                    somewhat pluggable (if it's worth doing - it's worth
                    overdoing) were great companions for early morning
                    espressos. Notice, how none of this involved writing any
                    posts yet. In the end - it sort of worked - maybe it will
                    even work better in the future - but I was still post-less.
                    Fast forward one or two more years.

                    Productivity hacking is all the rage now. We are taught to
                    wake up early (check), get at least some exercise in every
                    day (yup), create notes and reminders for the day and close
                    them during the day (been there) and many other things to
                    get those little wins while we're stuck at home for weeks on
                    end. For me - the perfect time to start writing. This time -
                    no styling, no static site generation, no templates. Just
                    me, the keyboard and an "index.html".
